# Todo App
This App will be helpful for managing day-to-day tasks.   
It allows the users to Create, Update and Delete the tasks.   
Using the search option, the user can search for a specific task.   
We also have a Dashboard section where users can check the number of pending and completed tasks.
There is no backend service linked with this application. But React components are developed in such a way that if I want to integrate with the APIs and store the information it won't take much effort for the integration part.
